# Handover

## What is the current status of the project?
The project is now more in its early stages. The project is made from scratch. A 2nd iteration of the design is made by our CMD students.

Code:
The CMS has been set up and a start has been made on coding the content.

Design:
A first 2nd iteration of the design has been made. This can be found in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&t=s3x0x3PTJk21DIHn-1).
There are several pages created. The content page shows the website. The components page contains the components that have been created and the inspiration page contains the mood boards and various ideas.

### Client information links + important information:
- The website of the project developer. Here you will find a lot of information about the district itself · <a href="https://bajeskwartier.com/nl/aanbod/"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- Figma file · <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1iCjUpcNcKRqhtHK-0"><strong>Link »</strong></a> 
- The handout in Notion about the residents and the neighborhood · <a href="https://picayune-passbook-cbe.notion.site/Hand-out-Bewoners-Bajeskwartier-Weespertrekvaartbuurt-1737a31f221e81b4af36df9b4c24aa27"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- Desk research · <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNBQqSZ-jSI8pTuEsEQOJoprIoXffzuH/view"><strong>Link »</strong></a>

## What are the main features that are already working?
- The data model of the CMS system has been set up. Example content has been placed in here. Make sure that the real content of the client is in the CMS. Content can be found in this document · <a href="https://icthva.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/FDMCI_RES_Healthy_Urban_Living_Lab_Bajeskwartier-FDND/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7Bb95cefa5-d07c-4689-a1be-33eb087fc665%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1749817553696&web=1"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- The queries of the CMS are written for each page. The CMS system and the pages are already connected to each other. - The design is already possible, the design can be copied.

## What are the biggest concerns or challenges?
- Content in de website zetten
- Iets met 3D ofzo


## What is recommended as a first step for the next team?
- It is the beginning of the project, so content needs to be added first.
- Because the CMS only contains example content, it is useful to use this file · <a href="https://icthva.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/FDMCI_RES_Healthy_Urban_Living_Lab_Bajeskwartier-FDND/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7Bb95cefa5-d07c-4689-a1be-33eb087fc665%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1749817553696&web=1"><strong>Link »</strong></a> to complete the content. If this link does not work, it is a good idea to ask the client for the content.
- Sample files have been created for the components, but not every component has been written and connected to each other. It is good to create the components together with the content.
- The design is already in the Figma file· <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1iCjUpcNcKRqhtHK-0"><strong>Link »</strong></a>  made, good to recreate this as soon as possible.
