# Handover

## What is the current status of the project?
The project is now more in its early stages. The project is made from scratch. A 2nd iteration of the design is made by our CMD students.

Code:
The CMS has been set up and a start has been made on adding the content in HTML.

Design:
A first iteration of the design has been made. This can be found in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&t=s3x0x3PTJk21DIHn-1).
There are several pages created. The content page shows the website. The components page contains the components that have been created and the inspiration page contains the mood boards and various ideas.

### Client information links + important information:
- The website of the project developer. Here you will find a lot of information about the district itself. Keep in mind that the style of this website should NOT be related to this website. The project developer and the Living Lab are two entirely seperate entities. · <a href="https://bajeskwartier.com/nl/aanbod/"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- Figma file · <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1iCjUpcNcKRqhtHK-0"><strong>Link »</strong></a> 
- The handout in Notion about the residents and the neighborhood · <a href="https://picayune-passbook-cbe.notion.site/Hand-out-Bewoners-Bajeskwartier-Weespertrekvaartbuurt-1737a31f221e81b4af36df9b4c24aa27"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- Desk research · <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNBQqSZ-jSI8pTuEsEQOJoprIoXffzuH/view"><strong>Link »</strong></a>

## What are the main features that are already working?
- The data model of the CMS system has been set up. Example content has been placed in here. Make sure that the real content of the client is in the CMS. Content can be found in this document · <a href="https://icthva.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/FDMCI_RES_Healthy_Urban_Living_Lab_Bajeskwartier-FDND/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7Bb95cefa5-d07c-4689-a1be-33eb087fc665%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1749817553696&web=1"><strong>Link »</strong></a>
- The queries of the CMS are written for each page. The CMS system and the pages are already connected to each other. - The design is already possible, the design can be copied.

## What are the biggest concerns or challenges?
- Adding content to the website
- The website should ideally become a bold and pioneering project to show off FDND's capabilities. To achieve this, the current working idea is to incorporate some kind of 3D visualisation using ThreeJS.


## What is recommended as a first step for the next team?
- It is the beginning of the project, so content needs to be added first.
- Because the CMS only contains example content, it is useful to use this file · <a href="https://icthva.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/FDMCI_RES_Healthy_Urban_Living_Lab_Bajeskwartier-FDND/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7Bb95cefa5-d07c-4689-a1be-33eb087fc665%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1749817553696&web=1"><strong>Link »</strong></a> to complete the content. If this link does not work, it is a good idea to ask the client for the content.
- Sample files have been created for the components, but not every component has been written and connected to each other. It is good to create the components together with the content.
- The design is already in the Figma file· <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/cEjjEQCAEYbJp9kQnbpzmz/Website-Living-Lab-Bajeskwartier?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1iCjUpcNcKRqhtHK-0"><strong>Link »</strong></a>, it's a good idea to recreate this as soon as possible.

# What still needs to be done (design wise):


## General

<ins>Header</ins>
- Replace the current hook with a platform (Think of a hook holding a concrete slab).

<ins>Footer</ins>
- Try to optimize this; it still feels a bit empty. Consider playing with the layout.

## Home Page

<ins>Improve the parallax</ins>
- Use better photos
- Add more greenery
- Try to use more of the “cut-and-paste” effect to create more depth
- Consider sparring with the client about this

<ins>Theme Lines</ins>
- The client wants to keep an animation – look into how you can improve the current one
- Create your own icons; the current ones are placeholders

<ins>Projects</ins>
- Replace the photos here as well; ask the client for more images if needed

## About Us Page

<ins>Our Team</ins>
- Ask the client for photos and additional info about the internal team

<ins>Theme Line</ins>
- Replace placeholder text and icons

<ins>Prevent</ins>

## Projects Page

<ins>Photo Collage</ins>
- Replace placeholders with real photos and project titles

## Project Detail Page

<ins>Project info Text</ins>
- Replace placeholders with actual text and titles

<ins>Photo Collage</ins>
- Replace placeholders with real photos and project titles

<ins>3D Map</ins>
- Create a real 3D map of the Bajesbuurt (discuss this with the client first)
Try to optimize this feature in a way that is also clear to the client

## Network Page

<ins>Intro Text</ins>
- Ask the client for a short introduction about the network

<ins>Icons and Info</ins>
- Ask the client for photos to replace the placeholders
The actual names are listed in the Word content document

<ins>Quotes</ins>
- The client wanted to add quotes to some icons,follow up on this in further conversations

## News Page
