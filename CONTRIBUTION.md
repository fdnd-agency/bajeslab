![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d0b538-718e-4b91-a93c-a337127818d4)
Use the development tool for creating new branches. Here Github automatically creates a new branch from a created issue.
This tool can be seen in the right column menu of an issue.

The name of a branch is: issueNumber-issue-title

## How to make commits (e.g. “Use clear commit messages in the form of: [type]: [description]”).
"At FDND Agency, because of Semantic Versioning, we use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Conventional commit is a specification, a set of rules that have to be followed when writing commit messages."

**Allowed Commit types:**
`build: ...` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
`chore: ...` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
`ci: ...` Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (GitHub Actions, netlify.toml)
`docs: ...` Changes to documentation, eg: Readme.md, Handover.md or Figma files or design rationale in the Wiki
`feat: ...` Implementing a new feature
`fix: ...` Fix for a bug, style or layout issue
`perf: ...` A code change that improves performance
`refactor: ...` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature but improves structure or readability
`style: ...` Changes that affect readability but not the working of the code (source formatting, adding tabs or newline)
`test: ...` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
